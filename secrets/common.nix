  # This file is significantly simplified.
  # agenix manages identities and secret files primarily through
  # the age.identityPaths and age.secrets definitions,
  # typically in a central agenix configuration file (e.g., secrets/agenix.nix)
  # or directly within NixOS/Home Manager modules.

  # The commented-out age.secrets block is an example of how sops-nix
  # might have directly referenced .age files. Agenix uses a similar
  # concept but structured differently within its own module system.
